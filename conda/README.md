# conda

Conda is an open-source package and environment management software that can run on multiple operation systems.

- As a package manager, Conda can help find and install Python packages and their dependencies.
- As environment manager, Conda can create and manage virtual environments on the computer.

Conda environments allow users to manage project dependencies effectively, and it offers a command-line interface for package and environment operations.

## How to install it?

Before the installation, make sure you are not confused with Conda, Miniconda, and Anaconda.

- Conda is the core tool for managing virtual environments and installing packages.
- Miniconda combines Conda, Python, and some base core packages.
- Anaconda includes Miniconda as well as a large of the most widely used Python packages.
